# Predicting Subscription Churn Using Customer Sentiment Analysis and Behavioral Data

## Overview

This project aims to improve customer retention for a subscription service by developing a predictive model for churn.  The model integrates both behavioral data (e.g., usage patterns, payment history) and customer sentiment extracted from social media posts and support tickets.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (using a specified algorithm -  this would be detailed further within the project itself), and model evaluation to identify subscribers at high risk of churning.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results and metrics to the console, including model performance evaluations (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing churn rates over time, feature importance, etc.)  These files will be saved in the `output` directory.  Example output files might include: `churn_rate_trend.png`, `feature_importance.png`.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the analysis performed.
